    "Initially, we plan to work on the event \"#WWDC2017\" held in June 2017. During the twitter scrapping part, we realized that it could be pretty hard for us to get achive data for 6 months. So we decided to change our topic to \"#MicrosoftAI\" as Microsoft launched its new Artificial Intelligence product in Dec. 2017. But it turns out that not so many people is passionate about this topic and we could only get ~3000 tweets with over 70% RT. Then, we decided to shift to \"Magic Leap\", who launched its first product Magic Leap One on Dec. 20th and drove tech-enthusiastics very excited and talking about it all over twitter."
